# Omnifood Project

This is the final project of Jonas Schmedtmann's "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3" on Udemy. I adapted the project to include more advanced techniques not taught in the course, such as:

* PostCSS (variables, nesting, mixins)
* Gulp (watch task, css filter task, final build task)
* Modular CSS organization
* BEM methodology

These were incorporated to practice skills from other courses, and to avoid simply copying the instructor verbatim. The responsive design is mostly my own.
